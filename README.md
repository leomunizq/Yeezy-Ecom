# Responsive Ecommerce Website Sneakers
I decided to do a personal project, as I really like Yeezy sneakers, I decided to make an e-commerce based on this.

I used:
<br>Grid-layout
<br>RevealJS
<br>SwipeJS
<br>and other javascript libs.
<br>Besides being 100% responsive.


The project is inspired by Marlon from bedimcode.
