# Responsive Ecommerce Website Sneakers
I decided to do a personal project, as I really like Yeezy sneakers, I decided to make an e-commerce based on this.

I used:
Grid-layout
RevealJS
SwipeJS
and other javascript libs.
Besides being 100% responsive.


The project is inspired by Marlon from bedimcode.
